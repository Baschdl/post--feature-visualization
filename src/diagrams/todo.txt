* Do we want to somehow show real data examples for each visualization?
** Integrated into the diagrams? Link to appendix?

* Flip learning rate direction

* Add plot of loss curves -- add special diagram?

* Visualizing later neurons can be harder
** Mention in diversity section?

* Challenges with inceptionv3

* "Frequency Penalization" -- maybe "Frequency prior?"

* Total variation is absolute value differences?
** Should preserve edges

* gradient blurring; do we want saying further?

* Do we want to mention style transfer?
** Total variation often gets used
** can run into checkerboarding


* Interaction
** Diversity and feature visualization?

* Evolution?
* Model comparison?
* Appendices





* t-SNE of feature vectors, classes




===============


What insights do we have:

(1) Feature visualization makes neurons and activations meaningful
(2) Attribution is more than just heatmaps on original image
    - Can be applied to hidden units
    - Attribution on higher-diemsnional outputs, counterfactuals
(3) We can reduce neurons into groups for a particular example to make understanding more tractable

Other things:
* Graphs
* Alex' t-sne vis of activations??
* How feature get built up?
** Could talk about how one would manually build a rotated square detector?




====== Design ToDos

-[x] hero larger and responsive
-[x] redo worst static diagrams
-[ ] sliders on mobile devices
-[x] optimize spritesheets
-[ ] formula for diversity (gram-matrix one)
-[ ] diversity: bad examples
-[ ] link to site with all neuron visualizations?
-[x] diversity examples update (colab link?)
-[x] interpolation: merge into diversity
  -[ ] colab link(?)
-[ ] cite tags in regularization review table
-[ ] frequency: l1, blur, tv
-[ ] jitter explanation: footnote
-[ ] optimization researcher
-[ ] descent: appendix/footnote
-[ ] citation: with frequencies scaled so that they all have equal energy
-[ ] overview of techniques side by side static diagrqam in conclusion
-[x] comment out practicality
-[x] check transforms example parameterization (maybe inadvertently more robust)
